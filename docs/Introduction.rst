Introduction
=============

The Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), also known (due to a re-branding exercise) as the `eXtreme Deep Field (XDF) <http://xdf.ucolick.org>`_ , is the Hubble Space Telescopeâ€™s deepest view of the Universe.
The aim of this project is to become familiar with analysing Hubble imaging using python. The ultimate goal is to identify candidate high-redshift galaxies.
